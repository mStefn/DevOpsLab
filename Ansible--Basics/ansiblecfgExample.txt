[defaults] Section
host_key_checking=False: Disables SSH host key checking, useful in testing but risky in production.
inventory = ./inventory: Specifies the path to the inventory file.
forks = 5: Limits the number of parallel connections to 5.
log_path = /var/log/ansible.log: Sets the path for Ansible logs.

[privilege_escalation] Section
become=True: Enables privilege escalation by default.
become_method=sudo: Uses sudo for privilege escalation.
become_ask_pass=False: Disables password prompt for sudo.


In summary, this config sets up key defaults like disabling SSH key checks, defining inventory location, parallel task limits, logging, and privilege escalation settings.
